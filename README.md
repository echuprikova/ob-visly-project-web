# Abstract

Increasing challenges for agricultural production such as climate change, environmental concerns, energy demands, and growing expectations from consumers triggered the necessity for innovation using data-driven approaches such as visual analytics. OB-VISLY extends the visual analytics approach with a structural way of data organization (ontologies), data mining, and visualization techniques to retrieve knowledge from the agricultural monitoring data. The latest advances in data visualization and analytics made it possible to fully exploit the potential of the proposed approach and gain insights into high complexity datasets (multi-source, multi-scale, and different stages). 

In **OB-VISLY** (EU funded MSCA-IF), I will carry out state-of-the-art research that unites two strands of recent, significant inquiry: Big Data analytics in the agricultural sector and visual methods. 


### Partners

OB-VISLY aims at applying cross-disciplinary methods in collaboration with regional (Laimburg Research, UniBZ) and international partners (MISTEA Montpellier SupAgro, INRA (secondment); Wageningen U&R).

## Study area
The partner of this study, Laimburg Research Center, kindly provides the dataset about Apple Variety Testing Program

## Objectives
OB-VISLY aims to (1) establish a regionally significant dataspace enabled to synthesize information about fruit-growing apple orchards and vineyards and derive insight from massive, dynamic, and often conflicting data by providing up-to-date, consistent, and credible assessments; (2) create a single visual analytics user interface thatcan turn the data into knowledge for users of different information retrieval proficiency.
