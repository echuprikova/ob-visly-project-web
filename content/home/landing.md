OB-VISLY aims to build a human-centered approach to Big Data acquired from agricultural monitoring (in
particular apple orchards and vineyards) by developing ontology-based visual analytics. OB-VISLY will be
designed as an interactive visual analytics system enabled to answer "what" and "why" about fruit-growing
activities. Thus, the system will go beyond the traditional ways of organizing data by creating a dataspace
to explore and get insight. The main objectives are:

- To establish a regionally important dataspace enabled to (a) synthesize information about fruit-growing
apple orchards and vineyards and (b) derive insight from massive, dynamic, and often conflicting data
by providing up-to-date, consistent, and credible assessments from agricultural monitoring data.

- To create (a) a single visual analytics user interface that can (b) turn the data into knowledge for users
of different information retrieval proficiency.
