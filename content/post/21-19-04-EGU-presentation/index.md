We hold a vPICO presentation at the vEGU21 European Geosciences Union (EGU) General Assembly 2021, which took place on 27th April: "An Ontology-based Visual Analytics for Apple Variety Testing"! Session GI2.1: https://lnkd.in/etMRAxi

This short presentation set the path towards the project OB-VISLY, which unites two strands of recent, significant inquiry: data integration and knowledge retrieval & visualization. Building upon Virtual Knowledge Graph System - Ontop developed by the KRDB Centre (Free University of Bozen-Bolzano) and the Apple Variety Testing dataset provided by Laimburg Research Centre, we presented the project outgoing activities.
