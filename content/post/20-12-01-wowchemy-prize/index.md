Increasing challenges for agricultural production such as climate change, environmental concerns, energy demands, and growing expectations from consumers triggered the necessity for innovation using data-driven approaches such as visual analytics. OB-VISLY extends the visual analytics approach with a structural way of data organization (ontologies), data mining, and visualization techniques to retrieve knowledge from the agricultural monitoring data.

OB-VISLY will establish and implement regionally innovative visual analytics-enabled interface for the fruit-growing apple orchards and vineyards in South Tyrol.
